# Reproducer CVE-2023-1422
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/zephyr-os/CVE-2023-1422-hci-sent_cmd-shared-reference-race-condition.md).

The use-after-free condition leads to an invalid state in the networking buffer.
During a call to `net_buf_simple_add_mem` a pointer to a corrupted network buffer is used.
The pointer is passed in `r0` and is NULL, plus a struct offset, as the register dump shows.
Writing to this address causes a crash as the memory is read only.
