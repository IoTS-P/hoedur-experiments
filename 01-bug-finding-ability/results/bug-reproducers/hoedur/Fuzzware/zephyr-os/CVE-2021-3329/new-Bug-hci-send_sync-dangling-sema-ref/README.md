# Reproducer CVE-2023-1901
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/zephyr-os/CVE-2023-1901-hci-send_sync-dangling-semaphore-reference-reuse.md).

The dangling semaphore is passed to `k_sem_give` which internally calls `z_priq_dumb_remove` with a thread object in `r1`.
In this function a 8 byte memory access on this object is performed.
As can bee seen from the register dump this address is not aligned to an 8 byte boundary.
This misalignment causes a `UsageFault` and thus shows an invalid memory access.
