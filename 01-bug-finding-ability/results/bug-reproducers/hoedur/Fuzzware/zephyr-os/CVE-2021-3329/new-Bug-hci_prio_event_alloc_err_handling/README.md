# Reproducer CVE-2023-1423
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/zephyr-os/CVE-2023-1423-hci-isr-invalid-alloc-nullptr.md).

As described in the writeup a NULL pointer is passed to `net_buf_simple_reserve` as can bee seen by the value of `r0`.
Then while writing to this pointer a crash happens as this is a read only memory region.
