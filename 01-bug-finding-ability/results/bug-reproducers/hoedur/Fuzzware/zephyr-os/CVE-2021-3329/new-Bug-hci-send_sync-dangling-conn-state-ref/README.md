# Reproducer CVE-2023-1902
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/zephyr-os/CVE-2023-1902-hci-connection-creation-dangling-state-reference-reuse.md).

Due to the dangling state reference a invalid target address is passed to `atomic_set_bit_to` which forwards it to `atomic_or`.
There the address is moved to `r3` and accessed.
The register dump shows that this is not a valid memory address.
As the memory access is performed with an exclusive load instruction a `UsageFault` occurs instead of the usual `HardFault`.
