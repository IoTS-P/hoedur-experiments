# Reproducer CVE-2023-0397
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/zephyr-os/CVE-2023-0397-hci-le_read_buffer_size-DoS.md).

Inside of `z_impl_k_sem_take` the `wait_q` is passed to `add_to_waitq_locked`.
Then a pointer is read from the uninitialized queue into `r3`, which the register dump shows to be NULL.
Next the point is written to and thus causes a crash due to writing to read only memory.
