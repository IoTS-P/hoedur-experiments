# Reproducer CVE-2023-23609
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/contiki-ng/CVE-2023-23609-bt_l2cap_sdu_length_OOB.md).

The overwrite in `packetbuf_aligned` leads to a corruption of the immediately following `ip_processor_list_list`.
Later the corrupted value is used in `netstack_process_ip_callback`.
Here the value is loaded to `r4` and then accessed.
The register dump shows that the fuzzer generated a valid mmio address for this value.
Then a pointer is read from this address, saved to `r3` and then used as target for a indirekt branch.
But this address is not valid and thus crashes the firmware execution.
