# Reproducer CVE-2023-28116
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/contiki-ng/CVE-2023-28116-ble-mac_config-OOB.md).

The overwrite in `packetbuf_aligned` leads to a corruption of the immediately following `ip_processor_list_list`.
Later the corrupted value is used in `netstack_process_ip_callback`.
Here the value is loaded to `r4` and then accessed.
The register dump shows that this value is not a valid memory address.
