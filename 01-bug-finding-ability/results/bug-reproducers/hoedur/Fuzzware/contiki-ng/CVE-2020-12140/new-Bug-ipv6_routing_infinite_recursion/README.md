# Reproducer CVE-2023-29001
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../../04-prev-unknown-vulns/bug-details/contiki-ng/CVE-2023-29001-ipv6_routing_header_recursion.md).

The recursion leads to the corruption of the return address of `tcpip_ipv6_output`.
Once the function returns the `pc` will be set to an invalid address.
For the given reproducer this address is zero and thus immediately results in a crash.
