# Reproducer CVE-2023-24825
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/riot/CVE-2023-24825.md).

A pointer to the data of the packet that was completely marked is passed to `_iphc_ipv6_decode`.
The pointer is located in `r0` which is NULL.
Thus while accessing the data a NULL pointer dereference occurs.
