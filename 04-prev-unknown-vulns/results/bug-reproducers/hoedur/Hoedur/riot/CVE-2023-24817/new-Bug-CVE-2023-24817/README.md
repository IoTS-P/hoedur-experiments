# Reproducer CVE-2023-24817
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/riot/CVE-2023-24817.md).

The out-of-bounds access destroys some of the metadata of the packet buffer heap.
During allocation a invalid chunk address is dereferenced.
In this case the address is stored in `r0` and the register dump shows that this address is not a valid memory region.
