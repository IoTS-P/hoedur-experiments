# Reproducer CVE-2023-24819
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/riot/CVE-2023-24819.md).

The out-of-bounds write corrupts metadata that is used by the packet buffer heap.
While deallocating a chunk this corrupted metadata is accessed.
In this case the value in `r4` is dereferenced.
The register dump shows that this value is not a valid memory address.
