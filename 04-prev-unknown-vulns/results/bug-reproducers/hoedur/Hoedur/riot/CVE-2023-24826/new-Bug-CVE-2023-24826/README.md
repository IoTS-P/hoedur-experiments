# Reproducer CVE-2023-24826
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/riot/CVE-2023-24826.md).

It can bee seen that the firmware tries to execute an instruction at address 0.
The return address is located in `ztimer_handler`.
Thus we can be sure that the uninitialized timer is the cause of this crash.
