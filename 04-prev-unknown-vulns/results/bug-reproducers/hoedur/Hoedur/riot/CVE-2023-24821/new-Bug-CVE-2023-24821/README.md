# Reproducer CVE-2023-24821
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/riot/CVE-2023-24821.md).

In the debug configuration RIOT uses the memory protection unit to detect stack overflows.
The large out-of-bounds `memcpy` triggers this protection.
The accessed address is located in `r3` and from the register dump it can bee seen that this is a valid address.
But due to the MPU configuration a crash is still triggered.
This is also highlighted by the crash reason, which in this case is `MemoryManagement` instead of `HardFault`.
Without the debug configuration the `memcpy` would continue and create a crash once the end of available memory is reached.
