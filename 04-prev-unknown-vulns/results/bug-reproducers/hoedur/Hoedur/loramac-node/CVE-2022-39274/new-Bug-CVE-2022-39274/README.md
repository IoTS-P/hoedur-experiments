# Reproducer CVE-2022-39274
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/loramac-node/CVE-2022-39274-ProcessRadioRxDone-payload-oob.md).

The integer underflow in the `memcpy` size exceeds the size of the memory in the source buffer.
Thus the firmware crashes once an unmapped memory page is accessed.
`memcpy` uses `r1` as register for the source address.
In the register dump it can bee seen that `r1` just passed the page boundary and is now in unmapped memory.
