# Reproducer CVE-2022-41972
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/contiki-ng/CVE-2022-41972-bt_l2cap_credit_missing_null_check.md).

The address of the l2cap credits is stored in `r5` and dereferenced.
In the register dump it can bee seen that this address is NULL and thus causes a NULL pointer dereference.
