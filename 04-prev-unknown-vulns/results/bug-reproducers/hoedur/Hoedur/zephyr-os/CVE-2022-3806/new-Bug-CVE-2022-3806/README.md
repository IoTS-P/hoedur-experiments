# Reproducer CVE-2022-3806
For the bug details see the [writeup](../../../../../../../../bug-details/zephyr-os/CVE-2022-3806-hci-send_error_double_free.md).

The double free results in the creation of a network buffer with a NULL pointer as `data`.
This `data` pointer is then passed to `memcpy` resulting in a NULL pointer dereference.
`memcpy` stores the destination pointer in the register `r3` which is 0, as can be seen in the register dump.
