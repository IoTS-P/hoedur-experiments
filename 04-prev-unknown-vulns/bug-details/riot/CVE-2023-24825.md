# NULL Pointer dereference in gnrc_pktbuf_mark

## Summary
If an entire snippet of a packet is marked with `gnrc_pktbuf_mark`, `pkt->data` will be set to `NULL` but not deleted.

## Description
If `gnrc_pktbuf_mark` is used to mark an entire snippet and `pkt->size` is already aligned then `pkt->data` will be set to `NULL` [source](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/ccbb304eae7b59e8aca24a6ffd095b5b3f7720ee/sys/net/gnrc/pktbuf_static/gnrc_pktbuf_static.c#L169):
```
    pkt->data = (pkt->size != size) ? (((uint8_t *)pkt->data) + size) :
                                      NULL;
```
The `NULL` pointer snippet is not removed from the packet chain.
During later use of the packet a null pointer dereference occurs.

## Impact
* A crafted packet can trigger a null pointer dereference, leading to DoS

## Potential fix
If the entire snippet is marked, change the type and don't create a new one.
This will prevent the old snippet from having no data.
